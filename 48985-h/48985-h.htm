<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is just a year ago since this Essay on “The
English Flower Garden” was published in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i>.</p>

<p>It was written with a twofold object: to give
in the smallest compass an outline history of
English gardens, and to show once again what
makes the true charm and happiness of a garden.
Many&mdash;perhaps too partial&mdash;friends have urged
me to reprint this article. They have reminded
me that, when the immediate circulation of any
one number of a Review has ceased, its articles
are virtually lost and buried, and they assure me
that there are readers who may not have already
seen, and who would yet care to read, this Essay.
I hardly know how this may be, but I do know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
how very much I am indebted to the proprietor of
the <i>Quarterly</i> for his great kindness in allowing
me the opportunity of this reprint. Should this
little book succeed in retaining the friends that
<i>A Year in a Lancashire Garden</i> was happy
enough to make, it will indeed be fortunate. It
has been to me a matter of no little surprise
(as, naturally, of pleasure) to find from the
generous notices of the Press and from numerous
private letters from owners of gardens, to whom
I am entirely a stranger, that the views I have
expressed as to the necessity of a reform in our
gardens are very widely held. So long as a
garden is only regarded as a means for displaying
masses of gay colouring, half the delight
and all the real interest of it are gone. It is
only when we learn to make friends of individual
plants, and recall their history and associations,
that a garden becomes a pleasure for the
intellect as well as for the senses. But I do
not wish to carry my opinions to any extravagant
length. It is Voltaire, I think, who
says that “a man may have preferences but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
no exclusions,” and I certainly would exclude
nothing that is good in the present system.
Bedding-out is occasionally very effective and
sometimes necessary; and, on the other hand, a
garden&mdash;such as I saw suggested somewhere the
other day&mdash;which should contain only flowers
known to Chaucer, would be extremely disappointing.
However, bedding-out can take very
good care of itself, and Chaucerian gardens will
not be largely popular. Meanwhile, I sincerely
hope that flowering shrubs and hardy herbaceous
plants may be far more generally grown and
cared for than they are at present.</p>

<p>It has seemed on the whole best to leave
this Essay as it was written. I have made a
few verbal corrections and inserted one or two
short sentences, and that is all. I have, however,
added illustrative Notes on points which
seemed of some little interest.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE ENGLISH FLOWER GARDEN.</h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">As</span> spring comes on, the fancy of any man
who cares about a garden, “lightly turns to
thoughts” of flowers and the gardens where
they grow. Never, perhaps, was the art of
gardening so popular,&mdash;I wish we could say
so intelligent,&mdash;as at present. The stately homes
of England, the villas that line the roads of
suburban districts, the cottages clustering round
a village green, often even a back yard or
window-sill in the heart of some manufacturing
town, all testify in their different ways to the
desire of having an adornment of flowers.
Indeed this desire, as Bacon long ago pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
out, in his famous and often-quoted essay, is
as old as man himself; or, if any one prefer
to trace back the instinct, not to the Garden of
Eden, but to the habits of a bird, he may be
reminded of the Gardener Bower-bird (<i>Amblyornis
inornata</i>) of New Guinea, who, making a
bower for the pleasure of his mate, will decorate
the front of it with flowers carefully stuck into
the sod.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Nothing more strikingly shows the interest
that is now taken in gardening than the number
of books that are published on the subject.
Besides those that deal less with the craft of the
gardener than with the flowers themselves,
we have Manuals of gardening, with their annual
and monthly calendars of gardening operations,
their practical advice and technical knowledge.
Then there are the almost countless catalogues
of the nurserymen and seedsmen, which often
add excellent, and sometimes coloured, engravings,
and always supply much useful information.
Moreover, in addition to the gardening articles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>that appear in the <i>Field</i> and elsewhere, there
are no less than six weekly newspapers, and five
monthly periodicals, all devoted to gardening.
Lastly, from time to time some publication
comes out in parts, as a monograph on some
particular species or group of plants, which,
with its beautifully-painted illustrations, will one
day take its place among other magnificent
folios in the botanical libraries of the world.</p>

<p>So much has been written about the old
English or Elizabethan garden, that I need
hardly enter into great detail on the subject.
Bacon has told us what his ideal garden was&mdash;the
outside lawn, the enclosed garden, and the
wilderness. Of course few gardens can ever
have approached the perfection of which he
dreams, but his general type was the type of
the garden of his day. He does not approve
of “the making of knots or figures with divers
coloured earths” near the house; but in the
garden proper, which is enclosed by hedges
with green alleys running past them, he will
allow of “variety of device.” Each month is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
have its own flowers, and he values flowers, as
Milton seems to have done, more for fragrance
than for colour. And the variety of flowers
of the old garden was, even in comparatively
small places, far greater than we might at first
suppose. Thomas Tusser, who was then a
Suffolk farmer, published his <i>Points of Husbandry</i>
in 1557, and he gives a long list of the plants
he grew for the kitchen, for salads, for physic,
and of flowers for “windows and pots.” The
New Shakespeare Society, too, has lately been
reprinting Harrison’s <i>Description of England</i>, first
printed in 1577, and he, in a chapter on gardening,
describes his own “little plot, void of
all cost in keeping,” as having, “in the varietie
of simples,” “verie neere three hundred of one
sort and other contained therein, no one of them
being common or usually to be had.”</p>

<p>Two of the most celebrated gardens of those
days were Nonsuch and Cobham. Nonsuch
seems to have had a number of statues, and a
wonderful fountain, with Diana and Actæon;
and its lilac-trees are particularly mentioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Of Cobham, in Kent, then belonging to Lord
Cobham, but now to Lord Darnley, Holinshed
says, “No varietie of strange flowers and trees
do want, which praise or price maie obtaine
from the furthest part of Europe or from other
strange countries, whereby it is not inferior to
the Garden of Semiramis.” A little later, Lord
Fairfax’s garden at Nun-Appleton was glorified
by Andrew Marvell. It was built, as was supposed
to be appropriate for a soldier’s garden,
in the form of a fort with five bastions, and</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">“the flowers as on parade<br />
Under their colours stand displayed,<br />
Each regiment in order grows,<br />
That of the tulip, pink, and rose.”</p>

<p class="p1">Later on still (in 1685) Sir William Temple,
in his celebrated essay, described the gardens
in his day as not often exceeding six or eight
acres, enclosed by walls, and “laid out in a
manner wholly for advantage of fruits, flowers,
and the product of kitchen gardens.” He goes
on to say, that</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In every garden four things are necessary to be provided for,
flowers, fruit, shade and water, and whoever lays out a garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
without all these must not pretend to any perfection. It ought to
lie to the best parts of the house, so as to be but like one of the
rooms out of which you step into another. The part of your garden
next your house (besides the walls that go round it) should be a
parterre for flowers, and grass-plots bordered with flowers; or if,
according to the newest mode, it be cast all into grass-plots and
gravel walks, the dryness of these should be relieved with fountains,
and the plainness of those with statues.”</p>

<p class="p1">He then quotes the garden at Moor Park, made
by the Countess of Bedford, as “the perfectest
figure of a garden I ever saw.” He says, “the
length of the house, where the best rooms or of
most use or pleasure are, lies upon the breadth
of the garden:” the “great parlour” opens upon
a broad terrace walk, and then three flights of
steps descend to a very large parterre, with its
standard laurels, its fountains, and its statues.
This garden must obviously have been a garden
of an architectural rather than of a horticultural
character, and was not at all the ordinary garden
of the ordinary country house. But the garden,
which we properly associate with those described
by the poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, was the garden “enclosed by walls,”
within which were flower-beds and herb and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
kitchen gardens, divided by flowering shrubs, and
green walks, and verdant alleys. It was in such
a garden that Spenser’s butterfly met its untimely
end, and such were</p>

<p class="ppq p1">“The gardens of Adonis, fraught<br />
With pleasures manifold.”</p>

<p class="p1">It was in the “pleached bower” of such a
garden, where the ripe honeysuckles obscured
the sun, that Shakespeare’s Beatrice was to hide.
Of such a garden Andrew Marvell was thinking
when he described the lilies and roses, on which
Sylvio’s fawn was wont to feed. In these old
gardens Cowley wrote his essays; and Herrick
gathered the fancies of a poet, or the warnings
of a moralist, with his early violets and fading
daffodils.</p>

<p>And so, with but few changes, these Elizabethan
gardens grew on from year to year, till a certain
modification occurred when William III. introduced
a taste for whatever was characteristic of
Holland: statues were fewer, and hedges of box
or yew, clipped into fantastic shapes, became all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the fashion. These clipped hedges, indeed, were
no new invention, as Sir Walter Scott appears
to have thought, for Bacon had denounced
them. He did “not like images cut out in
juniper or other garden stuff, they be for children.”
Earlier still, Leland, in his <i>Itinerary</i>,
speaks of the Castle of Wrexhill, and says that
outside “the mote” were orchards, and “in the
orchards were mountes <i>opere topiario</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>But the most famous specimen of Topiarian
work in England is probably that at Levens
Hall in Westmoreland. It was the work of
Beaumont, a well-known gardener of his day,
and dates from 1701, the last year of William
III.’s reign. Colonel Graham was at that time
owner of Levens, and some curious letters from
his steward still exist, describing the laying-out
of the grounds and the planting of the yews, of
which one group was clipped into the shape of
Queen Elizabeth with her maids of honour.</p>

<p>Long rows of trees, moreover, were now formed
on the several sides of great houses, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Cobham (the varied fortune of whose garden is
singularly instructive) a semicircle of trees was
planted near the west front, from which radiated
five avenues. But the Dutch fashions and the
Topiarian work and the long avenues were to
be of no long duration. It is more than probable
that political feeling, as well as mere fashion,
may have had something to do with the change
in many cases; but, however this may be, those
who set themselves up as men of taste began
to find fault with the existing style. Pope was
among the first to discover that there was a
monotony when grove nodded to grove and each
alley had its brother, and he insisted that nature
must “never be forgot,” and that one must
“consult the genius of the place in all.” So he
set to work to consult the genius of his own
villa at Twickenham, and this genius certainly
prevented anything monotonous. He had flower-beds,
and slopes, and mounds, and vistas, and
a cypress-grove, and a shell-temple, and an
orangery, and a bowling-green, and, above all,
a wonderful grotto, “finished with shells, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
interspersed with pieces of looking-glass in
angular forms.”</p>

<p>And it was about this time that Batty Langley,
also of Twickenham, wrote his <i>New Principles
of Gardening, or the Laying-out and Planting
Parterres, Groves, Wildernesses, Labyrinths, Avenues,
Parks, &amp;c., after a more Grand and Rural
manner than has been done before</i>. This “grand
<i>and</i> rural manner” expresses pretty clearly the
confusion we find all through his book. He
must have known Pope’s villa, and probably
the poet himself, and it is evident that he too
intended to consult nature and the “genius” of
a place. He says there is not “anything more
<i>shocking</i> than a <i>stiff regular garden</i>, where, after
we have seen one quarter thereof, the very same
is repeated in all the remaining parts, so that
we are tired, instead of being further entertained
with something new as expected.” He
thinks “our gardens much the worst of any in
the world, some few excepted,” and is severe on
the late Mr. London and Mr. Wise for having laid
out gardens for the nobility “in a regular, stiff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and stuft-up manner,” with crowded evergreens
and “trifling flower-knots.” But the compliments
which he pays to nature are, after all, not much
more than lip-homage. His principles seem very
right, but his designs, of which we have very
many, show that the “grand” had quite got
the better of the “rural.” Even the design of
“a rural garden after the new manner” consists
of “a fine large plain parterre, environed with
an easy, agreeable slope,” and “adorned with
Apollo, Minerva, and Pallas (<i>sic</i>), the Seven
Liberal Arts, Mercury, and Pytho;” then there
is an octagon basin, with Neptune, and avenues
and canals and more statues, and “we can never
know when we have seen the whole.”</p>

<p>And now the period of the so-called “landscape
gardeners” began, though in reality their
business was rather with the <i>grounds</i> than with
the garden proper.</p>

<p>Of these Kent was the first of eminence. Their
idea was to destroy all the old-fashioned formalities,
at the sacrifice of a certain stateliness which
the style possessed, and to bring the scenery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of an English park up to the house itself. But
they were constantly haunted and harassed by
the word “picturesque.” Was Nature more
picturesque when closely followed or carefully
improved? Was it the duty of the landscape
gardener to arrange his clumps and belts of trees
in the way in which they would look best in a
<i>picture</i>? This was evidently Kent’s idea, and
Daines Barrington, speaking of him, says it was
reserved for him “to realize these beautiful
descriptions [in the <i>Faery Queen</i>], for which he
was peculiarly adapted by being a painter, as
the true test of perfection in a modern garden
is that a landscape painter would choose it as
a composition.” Kent’s great work seems to
have been the carrying out of the alterations at
Stowe, on which Bridgeman had been originally
employed, and much of the beauty of those
famous grounds&mdash;which, however, were at least
as artificial as natural&mdash;was owing to his taste.
The two peculiarities now generally associated
with his name are the planting of <i>dead trees</i> to
look picturesque, and the constant use of <i>Ha-ha’s</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
(or sunk fences), which he is often said to have
originated, though, as matter of fact, Batty
Langley also (and I think previously) advocates
their adoption.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> “Capability Brown” was perhaps
the next most noted landscape gardener. His idea
was always to improve nature, and he was particularly
strong in artificial lakes and canals, with
rather formal clumps of trees. He had many disciples,
and it seemed as if half the fine places in
England were to be reformed on the new principles.</p>

<p>But two formidable critics came into the field,
Knight and Price. Their plan was to leave
Nature as much as possible to herself, to let the
stream wind about as a stream should, instead
of being dammed into a canal, and to allow
trees to grow as they liked. Price’s famous
<i>Essay on the Picturesque</i> is still full of interest,
and shows good sense in the exceptions he
allows to his general rule, as, for instance, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>he admits “architectural ornaments” in the
garden round the house. He speaks, too, with
regret of having once destroyed a beautiful old
garden, “sacrificed to undulations of ground
only.” But he certainly seems to carry his
general rule to very considerable length. He
thinks that “many of the circumstances that
give variety and spirit to a wild place might
successfully be imitated in a dressed place;”
and although he cannot advocate modelling a
carriage-drive after a cart-rut, or having water-docks
or thistles before one’s door, he still
thinks the cart-rut and the thistles might furnish
useful hints. In another chapter he discusses
“the connection between picturesqueness and
deformity,” and explains how large heaps of
stones or mould may at first be considered as
deformities and afterwards appear picturesque.
It is impossible not to be reminded of Mrs.
Rafferty’s description of her garden in Miss
Edgeworth’s <i>Absentee</i>: “‘Yes,’ she said, ‘she
hated everything straight; it was so formal and
<i>unpicturesque</i>. Uniformity and conformity,’ she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
observed, ‘had their day, but now, thank the
stars of the present day, irregularity and deformity
bear the bell and have the majority.’”</p>

<p>Another novelist, Miss Austen, in her <i>Mansfield
Park</i>, preserves the name of Repton, who was
the last of the noted landscape gardeners of the
last century: “Repton, or anybody of that
sort,” says a certain Mr. Rushworth, “would
certainly have the avenue at Sotherton down;
the avenue that leads from the west front to
the top of the hill, you know.” And this is just
what Repton would have done. He was for
ever cutting down avenues, and out of the five
beautiful lime avenues at Cobham, which must
have given such a stately appearance to the
place, no less that four fell victims to his axe.
The idea was of course that avenues prevented
the ground from being picturesque and natural,
and Mason, in his <i>English Garden</i>, urges “the
cruel task, yet needful,” of breaking “th’ obdurate
line” of trees, though</p>

<p class="ppq p1">“A chosen few,&mdash;and yet, alas! but few&mdash;<br />
Of these, the old protectors of the plain,<br />
May yet be spared.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The next marked development in gardening
refers more particularly to the flower-garden
itself. It was between the years 1835 and 1840
that the mode which we call “bedding-out”
began to came into general fashion. John Caie,
who was gardener to the Duke of Bedford, and
afterwards at Inverary Castle, is often said to
have originated the system; but Mr. Frost,
writing from Dropmore to the editor of the
<i>Gardener’s Chronicle</i>, says:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I helped to fill the beds here in the spring of 1823, long before
Mr. Caie had charge of the Campden Hill gardens. It was Lady
Grenville who began the bedding system in the first place, but she
quite abhorred both ribbon and carpet bedding. The dowager
Duchess of Bedford used to visit the grounds here, and much
admired the garden, and when she went to Campden Hill to live
she sent Mr. Caie here to see the place, and very probably to take
notes of what he saw.”</p>

<p class="p1">It would thus appear that to Lady Grenville
in her Dropmore gardens the credit of being
the first to bed-out may fairly belong. But
some fifteen years passed before the system
was generally adopted. It then grew rapidly
in favour, and before long it was clear that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
whole character of the English garden would be
changed. One of the first plants to be bedded-out
extensively was the “Tom Thumb” pelargonium,
or geranium as it was then more commonly
called; it was a dwarf scarlet, and was considered
to be of great beauty till the better
varieties were introduced. Then followed verbeneas,
calceolarias, and other flowers, which
could be kept as cuttings through the winter,
and then be planted out when summer weather
made it safe to do so. And there were many
advantages in bedding-out. In large public
gardens, where a glow of colour only was wanted,
where no one stopped to look at any particular
plant, and where a certain uniformity of growth
was essential, it answered extremely well. In
gardens which are, as it were, the approaches
of great houses, and which seem laid out rather
by the architect than the gardener, the bedding-out
system was both convenient in itself and
striking in its effect. Nothing for instance, in
its way, can be more beautiful than to look
down from the long gallery at Crewe Hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
upon the formal garden with its curves of variegated
gravel and its thick box edging, its broad
terraced walks and flights of steps, guarded by
quaintly-carved balustrades and strange heraldic
monsters. But it hardly strikes one as a garden;
it is rather an appendage to the house itself,
adding to its stateliness, and recalling, by its
prevailing colours of buff and blue, the old
traditions of the family.</p>

<p>But what is all very well for public parks
and very important mansions is out of place in
smaller country houses, and becomes absurd in
small villa gardens. However, the fashion had
seized hold of gardeners and masters both, and
every one must have what was called an Italian
garden. But to make their Italian garden they
must do one of two things. They must either
root up the old herbaceous plants, which year
after year had blossomed and scented the air
in the old walled garden; or they must take
a piece of their lawn, and, cutting it up into
segments, then plant out their nurslings of the
greenhouse. It so chanced, moreover, that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
few years after the new fashion came in, the
duty on glass was taken off, and greenhouses,
which had once been a luxury, now became a
supposed necessary of life. Hence, bedding-out,
instead of being an expensive form of gardening,
became a singularly easy and not a very costly
method of having a certain show of bright and
effective colouring. But this colouring was all.
In the old walled garden, instead of the plants,
which so long had had their home there, each
of which knew its season and claimed welcome
as an old friend, there were bare beds till June,
and then, when the summer was hottest, a
glare of the hottest, brightest, colours. But the
walled garden was better than the newly-cut
circles on the lawn. In the garden there would
at least be the shade of one of the garden walls.
In the outside Italian garden, where, with the
smooth old turf, trees had been cut away, there
would be no shade whatever. Nobody would
really care to walk there, and probably no one
would be allowed to gather flowers, for fear of
spoiling the symmetry of the beds. Nor can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
any one feel the slightest interest about the
hundred little pelargoniums in one bed, or the
fifty calceolarias in the next. Each plant is
exactly like its neighbour. All individuality
has gone, and it is impossible to forget that
some four months is the limit of their short
lives, and that the next year a new “crop” of
pelargoniums and calceolarias, equally without
interest or character, will appear in their place.
Then too the bedded-out plants are plants with
no associations as regards the past. No poet
ever sang their beauty, and no legend tells the
origin of their birth. Again, they are almost
entirely destitute of scent, and to our forefathers
at least the scent of flowers was their chief
attraction. Often too it is questionable whether
a number of small beds cut out of the green
turf really looks well; in nine cases out of ten
it has a make-shift appearance; flowers were
wanted, and the lawn has been sacrificed.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” says Bacon, “is more pleasant
to the eye than green grass nicely shorn,”&mdash;a
sentiment which Mason, in that somewhat tiresome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
poem of his from which I have already
quoted, has sense enough to approve&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq p1">“For green is to the eye, what to the ear<br />
Is harmony, or to the smell the rose.”</p>

<p class="p1">But green lawns all over England were being
destroyed. The flower-borders, where there had
been no walled garden, had hitherto generally
followed the line of the shrubberies and plantations,
and the windings of garden walks; but
these and the flowers that grew there were
now neglected.</p>

<p>Still worse was the effect on the smaller
villa-gardens. They had had their flowers on
the sunny side of the garden wall, their pleasant
bit of lawn with specimen trees, their fence of
scented shrubs. The trees were destroyed, the
lawn was cut up; and all for the sake of red
and yellow patches during four summer months.
Even the cottagers in many places seem to have
forgotten the old English flowers, such as grew
in Perdita’s garden, the “hot lavender,” the
marygold, the crown-imperial and the lily, and
have taken to slips of pelargonium and the like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor even yet had the abuse of the bedding-out
system done its worst. There were still, as
we have said, in many gardens, strips of border
which, not being in the form of rounded beds,
were allowed, half under protest as it were, to
harbour some of the old flowers. Unfortunately
for them, ribbon borders were invented, and the
last sanctuary of herbaceous plants was often
ruthlessly destroyed. Pelargoniums again, and
calceolarias, with lobelias in front, and dark-leaved
perillas in the background, made up the
new ribbon border. It was no doubt effective
enough in its way, but we have now seen it
almost everywhere, and for the last fifteen years
at least. Of course there are happy variations
of it in great places, and where the gardener is
a man of taste and ability; but it sometimes
appears to us that such gardeners must be very
rare exceptions. Such a ribbon border as I
have described, and extremely badly grown
moreover, is, or was a year or two ago, supposed
to be the appropriate adornment of
Shakespeare’s garden at New Place in Stratford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>A further modification in the round beds has
been introduced still more recently. It is the
bedding-out of zonal pelargoniums, of echeverias,
and of other plants, whose beauty lies in the
foliage rather than the blossom. No doubt
they give softer tints to the general effect, but
they are a poor substitute for the varied beauty
of an old garden. It may be difficult to find
interest in the ordinary “bedding-out stuff,”
but they are poetry itself compared to plants
which chiefly remind one of the last days of the
garden of “the Sensitive Plant,” when, instead
of all odorous flowers, there were only growths</p>

<p class="ppq2 p1">“Whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck<br />
Like the water-snake’s belly and the toad’s back.”</p>

<p class="p1">And this latest fancy is itself falling into the
further degradation of <i>carpet</i>-bedding. That a
carpet should imitate a flower-bed is one thing;
years ago in <i>Casa Guidi Windows</i>, Mrs. Browning
wrote of some carpets, where</p>

<p class="ppi4 p1">“your foot<br />
Dips deep in velvet roses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">This may be well enough; but who wants
flower-beds to look like carpets? They may
strike you at first as being ingenious, and even
pretty, but the feeling is at once followed
by a sense of their essential debasement as
regards gardening. No flower is permitted, and
the glorification of stonecrops and houseleeks
is the chief result. But indeed the geometrical
figures of the carpet-bedding are not the worst.
The gardeners are now trying their skill in
designs on their carpet-beds, and names, mottoes,
coats of arms, and other frivolities, are
becoming common. The most stupid follies of
the Topiarian age were graceful and sensible
compared to this. It is less childish to trim
a yew-tree into a peacock than to arrange your
sedums and alternantheras to look like animals
on a badly-woven carpet. Nor has the absurdity
even the merit of being original. It is really
an old French invention, and about the time of
Henry IV. the gardens at Fontainebleau and
Chantilly were known for their quaint devices
in flowers, their ships, armorial bearings, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
cyphers interlaced. The whole matter has been
well summed up by Sir Joseph Hooker, who
writes:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It is indeed astonishing that the asters, helianthus, rudbeckias,
silphiums, and numberless other fine North American plants, all so
easily grown and so handsome, should be entirely neglected in
English gardens, and this in favour of carpets, hearthrugs, and
ribbons, forming patterns of violent colours, which, though admired
for being the fashion on the lawn and borders of our gardens and
grounds, would not be tolerated on the floor of a drawing-room or
boudoir.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Well, as we can do nothing worse in this
direction, we may at last hope for a reaction, in
which a new school, with some regard to nature,
but without the extravagance of the old “picturesque”
gardeners, may bring us back to good
taste and common sense.</p>

<p>It is of course absolutely impossible to form
even an estimate of the number of bedding-out
plants used in our gardens during a single season,
to be discarded when the season ends. It must
be something enormous. One single florist in
the neighbourhood of London sends to market
annually more than 80,000 plants of one description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>of pelargonium alone. It is calculated that
the bedding-out of a single good-sized garden
will take at least 100,000 plants to make it
effective.</p>

<p>But now, leaving the question of summer
bedding-out, we are glad to note signs of real
advance in other directions. It is something that
within the last ten or fifteen years our gardeners
should have discovered that bare earth, all spring,
is not particularly beautiful, and should have
taken to what is called Spring gardening. All
flowers are welcome in spring, and even masses
of double daisies are acceptable. But indeed in
all the most elaborate bedding-out of summer,
there is nothing that can give greater pleasure
for colouring than a blue lake of <i>Myosotis dissitiflora</i>,
or of autumn-sown <i>Nemophila insignis</i>.
Then again, owing to our more rapid and easy
intercourse with Holland and Belgium, tulips
and hyacinths, which, however, were always in
favour, are more used than they were some years
ago. The quantities sent over by the gardeners
of the Low Countries must be very great. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
only do the choicer bulbs go to our own nurserymen,
but they are now sent direct to many
private gardens; while large auction sales in
London, Liverpool, and elsewhere, clear off the
inferior roots or those exported by the less well-known
growers. Mr. Burbidge tells us that the
value of the flower-roots sent from Holland a
year or two ago was nearly 60,000<i>l.</i>, and one
English grower imports annually 160,000 tulip
bulbs. A certain proportion of these will be
required for forcing purposes for the house and
the conservatory, but many more will be used
in the open garden. A bed of well-grown tulips
is certainly a very beautiful object, and there
are some at least who believe in the rich fragrance
of the tulip, which a living poet says “might
be the very perfume of the sun.”</p>

<p>Besides the spring garden, there is in some
places the Semi-tropical garden, and in others
the Alpine garden. No one has done more than
has Mr. W. Robinson<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to call up an interest in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>the broad-foliaged plants which are the chief
ornament in the gardens of Paris, and in the
delicate tufts of flowers which nestle in the
crevices of our rockeries. But there is much
still to be done. It is, after all, only occasionally
that either Semi-tropical or Alpine gardening
is to be seen in any perfection. For the former,
Battersea and Victoria Parks are extremely good,
and for the latter the Messrs. Backhouse’s nursery,
near York, has a deserved reputation. Many
very handsome semi-tropical plants are all but
hardy, and require at most only a protection
during the winter months. The canna was
known to Gerard and to Cowley, and needs no
more care than a dahlia. The Pampas grass
and <i>Arundo conspicua</i> are perfectly hardy. The
<i>Arundinaria falcata</i> is rather more tender, but
unless it flowers, when, like the American aloe,
it will die, it will generally spring up from the
root, even when its long canes themselves are
cut by the frost. The aralia, ricinus, and others,
are no doubt safer for being housed during the
winter, and then plunged, either as centres for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
flower-beds, or as separate shrubs in the outside
garden. Nothing gives greater character to any
garden than the occasional introduction of plants
like these. They are now indeed all the more
needed since the old plan of having orangeries
has so nearly disappeared. And yet how well
worth the trouble&mdash;the very little trouble&mdash;that
it cost, the orangery always was. Nothing could
be more stately than a broad walk, along the
sides of which were ranged the orange-trees, each
in its huge tub, and each fruit-bearing and flowering
together. And with the orange-trees would
be the white-blossoming myrtles and the <i>Clethra
arborea</i>, with its scented sprays, like lily-of-the-valley.</p>

<p>As regards the Alpine garden, the first thing
to be remembered is, that the rockwork on which
it is to be formed should look as natural as
possible. Nothing can be more hideous than
the usual varieties of suburban rockeries, where
the intention seems to be to make everything as
unnatural and distorted as can well be imagined
How well one knows the jagged fragments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
red sandstone standing on end, or the blocks of
various formations heaped up together, with bits
of green glass, coarse coral, and big shells stuck
in at different corners, and with cement between
to keep all in place.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The rocks used should, if
possible, be the rocks of the country; they should
appear to crop up from the soil; and they should
be so laid that plants should really be able to
grow in their fissures and interstices. Scarcely
less important is the choice of a site, for if the
rock-garden is placed under the drip of trees it
is hopeless to expect that any of the more
delicate and beautiful Alpine plants can thrive.
Most ferns, on the other hand, will of course do
better in moist, shady places; so that it is
impossible successfully to combine the Alpine
garden and the fernery, as is very often attempted.
Let the Alpine plants have sun and
light, and give the ferns the cool shade in which
they are most at home. Aquilegias and a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>other woodland flowers may be planted in among
the osmunda, the hart’s-tongue, and other hardy
ferns; and rare mosses and lichens may be taught
to cling to the darker clefts and hollows of the
rock, as in one rockery which I know, where
the “shining moss” (<i>Schistostega pennata</i>) catches
and refracts the sunlight with a metallic lustre
like that of the humming-bird’s breast.</p>

<p>One of the greatest ornaments to a garden is
a fountain, but many fountains are curiously
ineffective. A fountain is most beautiful when
it leaps high into the air, and you can see it
against a background of green foliage. To
place a fountain among low flower-beds, and
then to substitute small fancy jets, that take
the shape of a cup, or trickle over into a basin
of gold-fish, or toy with a gilded ball, is to
do all that is possible to degrade it. The
real charm of a fountain is, when you come
upon it in some little grassy glade of the
“pleasaunce,” where it seems as though it
sought, in the strong rush of its waters, to vie
with the tall boles of the forest-trees that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
surround it. Such was the fountain in Leigh
Hunt’s <i>Story of Rimini</i>, which shot up “beneath
a shade of darksome pines,”</p>

<p class="ppq2 p1">“And ’twixt their shafts you saw the water bright,<br />
Which through the tops glimmered with show’ring light.”</p>

<p class="p1">Bacon speaks of a “heath or desert” as a
part of the garden, and says it is “to be framed
as much as may be to a natural wilderness.”
There are to be no trees there, but thickets of
honeysuckle and other trailing plants, and heaps
like molehills, set with pinks or periwinkles, or
violets, or various “sweet and sightly” flowers,
and on some of the heaps little bushes of juniper
or rosemary, or other low-growing shrubs, are
to be planted. Such a garden would hardly
seem to be one of “natural wildness”; but
Bacon’s theory that there should be a “wild
garden” is, with certain modifications, carried
out in various places. But to <i>cultivate</i> a wild
garden almost involves a paradox. The plants
should grow of their own accord, and as their
vagrant fancy takes them. The prettiest of all
wild gardens is when the bluebells are so thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that they seem a reflection of the sky, or the
celandine lies in sunny patches on a bank, or
the primrose and violet come up here and there
at the foot of old forest-trees. Sometimes, too,
less common flowers, which have been planted
years ago, and have spread as it has pleased
them, give an effect of even greater beauty. We
remember one large shrubbery all blue with
hepaticas, and another golden with the winter
aconite. Other plants, such as the anchusa or
the <i>Petasites fragrans</i>, may be trusted to take
care of themselves, and are well worth some
half-wild corner. On the other hand, it is not
well to attempt to grow native plants when the
conditions of their new life would be unfavourable.
It is almost sad to see some bee-orchis,
or grass of Parnassus, or mountain auricula, or
other rare British plant, transplanted into a
shrubbery border. It is far better to leave these
“wildings of nature,” as Campbell calls them,
in their native haunts, and to experience for
oneself a new pleasure in finding them growing
wild and vigorous on down, or bog, or hilly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
slope. Occasionally a garden flower which has
sprung up from some stray seed will add a
certain unexpected charm to a walk or grass
plot. Such flowers are in a sense weeds no
doubt, but “weeds of glorious feature,” and
there are few who, like Lady Byron&mdash;and the
story is characteristic&mdash;would at once order the
gardener to uproot them. One beautiful form
of semi-wild garden is where, on some piece of
rich peat soil, rhododendrons have been thickly
planted. There is a fine example of this at
Knowsley, where thousands of large shrubs are
growing in the greatest luxuriance, and where,
as the slight irregularity of the ground permits,
you pass between banks and slopes and hollows,
quite purple with the clustered blossoms.</p>

<p>It is of course impossible to lay down any
code of rules which would be equally applicable
to every garden. As I have already said, there
will always be a certain amount of bedding-out
necessary, especially for the architectural
gardens that surround a stately house; but we
may hope that in all bedding-out more attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
will be given than at present to the proper
harmony of colours. It really would sometimes
appear that half our English gardeners must be
colour-blind. The gaudiest and most glaring
contrasts pain instead of gratifying the eye,
with their crude patches of pink and red and
blue and yellow. In France the bedded-out
borders have more generally a variety of plants
mixed on the same bed, and this certainly tends
to soften the general effect.</p>

<p>But both in the outside lawns and shrubberies,
and in the walled inner garden, there is much
room for improvement. A great principle in
laying out the lawns is the old principle of
Batty Langley’s (a principle which he himself
parodied rather than illustrated) of so arranging
your grounds that everything cannot be seen at
once, and that each turn of the walks excites
some fresh interest. The curved lines of a
shrubbery, now approaching and now receding,
the grass running up into little bays and recesses
among deodaras and groups of rhododendrons,
specimen trees occasionally breaking a formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
line, but never dotted about at regular intervals,&mdash;these
are the features that lend attraction to
a lawn. We would allow of no flower-bed
whatever except the shrubbery border, though
an occasional clump of tritomas, of cannas, or
of Pampas grass, may take the place of flowering
shrubs, and start up from corners of the
grass. Their height and general aspect enables
them to form part of the picture. But&mdash;one
cannot repeat it too often&mdash;the expanse of the
lawn should be rarely broken except by shrubberies;
and that the lawn itself should be
carefully kept and free from weeds is of course
essential.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful gardens I ever
knew depended almost entirely on the arrangement
of its lawns and shrubberies. It had certainly
been most carefully and adroitly planned,
and it had every advantage in the soft climate of
the west of England. The various lawns were
divided by thick shrubberies, so that you wandered
on from one to the other, and always came on
something new. In front of these shrubberies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was a large margin of flower border, gay with
the most effective plants and annuals. At
one corner of the lawn a standard <i>Magnolia
grandiflora</i> of great size held up its chaliced
blossoms; at another a tulip-tree was laden
with hundreds of yellow flowers. Here a magnificent
<i>Salisburia</i> mocked the foliage of the
maiden-hair; and here an old cedar swept the
grass with its huge pendent branches. But the
main breadth of each lawn was never destroyed,
and past them you might see the reaches of a
river, now in one aspect, and now in another.
Each view was different, and each was a fresh
enjoyment and surprise.</p>

<p>A few years ago, and I revisited the place;
the “improver” had been at work, and had been
good enough to <i>open up</i> the view. Shrubberies
had disappeared, and lawns had been thrown
together. The pretty peeps among the trees
were gone, the long vistas had become open
spaces, and you saw at a glance all that there
was to be seen. Of course the herbaceous
borders, which once contained numberless rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and interesting plants, had disappeared, and the
lawn in front of the house was cut up into little
beds of red pelargoniums, yellow calceolarias, and
the rest.</p>

<p>But we have now to speak of the shrubbery.
It will depend on its situation whether or not it
is backed by forest-trees, but in any case it will
have a certain number of evergreens in front.
To plant evergreens alone is generally a mistake.
Horace Walpole says that he was “not fond
of total plantations of evergreens,” and he was
certainly right. Shrubberies composed entirely
of holly, yew, and pinus must inevitably have
a solid, heavy appearance, and their use in winter
barely compensates for their melancholy monotony
during the summer months. They should,
wherever it is possible, have deciduous flowering
shrubs planted in among them. Nothing can be
prettier than to see the dark shades of the evergreens
lighted up by the fresh tender green of
lilac or laburnum, while, later in the season, the
background of evergreen will in its turn give
effect to the purple plumes and golden tresses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
But there is great art in the laying out of shrubberies
and the arrangement of the shrubs. There
is the time of flowering to be considered, and no
less the various colours of the blossoms, while
(very occasionally it is true) the tints of the leaves,
as they first expand, or are touched by the chills
of autumn, and even the prevailing tone of bark
and branches, are studied, so that there may be
always some happy effect of colouring. But for
the most part all this is neglected. There are very
few gardeners who pay the attention they should
to the shrubbery, and still fewer owners of gardens
who care to interfere in the matter. A pinetum
has of late years become something of a fashion,
and is therefore often a subject of interest, but
the shrubbery and the shrubbery border are
scarcely regarded. Lilacs and laburnums, scarlet
thorns, and rhododendrons are very beautiful;
but to confine our flowering shrubs to these
implies either want of knowledge or want of taste.
There are numbers besides, perfectly hardy, or
only requiring some slight protection in the
winter, which are comparatively but little known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Even many old favourites have been allowed to
become unfamiliar. The white and yellow broom,
the Ghent azaleas (excepting perhaps the yellow
one), the barberry with its bunches of golden
blossom and coral fruit, the Buddleia with its
glaucous leaves and honeyed balls like tiny oranges,
the Gueldres rose covered with its large white
tufts of snow, the scarlet ribes with its brisk scent
of black currant, are not to be seen as often as
they once were. The Judas-tree (Cercis), whose
little clusters of pink pea-blossom come out so
early in the year, and the bladder-senna, whose
curious paper-like bags of seed, hanging late on
in autumn, burst as you press them with a sharp
report, are still more rarely to be found. Of later
introductions the Weigelia alone seems to hold its
own, but the <i>Desfontainea spinosa</i>, looking like a
holly, but throwing out scarlet and yellow tubes of
blossom, or the diplopappus, with its leaves like a
variegated thyme, and its flowers like a minute
aster, are hardly ever seen. But there are many
more as good as these.</p>

<p>For covering a house the large magnolia is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
perhaps more beautiful than anything. The perfume
of its white flowers, though too strong for the
house, fills the air for yards round, and comes in
stray whiffs through the open window. This
magnolia will flourish abundantly in most places,
and if it does not, it is probably owing to its
roots requiring to be cabined, cribbed, and confined.
Other good shrubs for the outside of the
house are the ceanothus, the escallonia, and the
cydonia or <i>Pyrus japonica</i>, and these two last are
well worth growing as independent shrubs. The
<i>Pyrus japonica</i>, moreover, when trained as a
hedge, and breaking out all along its twisted
stems into knots of cherry-coloured blossom, is
extremely beautiful.</p>

<p>And in the more favoured nooks of England
greenhouse shrubs, such as camellias and cytisus,
may be seen to flourish and flower abundantly in
the open air. There is a striking example of
this as far north as the Anglesea side of the
Menai Straits. Thirty years ago Sir John Hay
Williams determined to build a house and form
a garden on a steep field sloping down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
water’s edge. The excessive steepness of the
ground made it necessary to construct a number
of supporting walls to form terraces; and the
entire plan was carried out by the owner without
any professional assistance. Huge fuchsias,
myrtles, the <i>Fabiana imbricata</i>, and other beautiful
flowering shrubs grow up against the house, and,
sheltered by a terrace-wall, are magnificent
camellias and cytisus. I once saw this garden of
Rhianva under rather remarkable circumstances.
It was the Sunday (March 24, 1878) when the
ill-fated <i>Eurydice</i> went down. The snow-storm
came on, and the snow-flakes fell heavily on the
red and white camellias, which were then in great
perfection. An hour later, and the sun was again
shining, the snow was melting away, and the
blossoms appeared from beneath it as fresh as
if nothing had occurred.</p>

<p>In front of the shrubbery border should be
placed strong-growing hardy plants, which, once
planted, will give no further trouble. The monks-hood,
with its quaint indigo blossoms, the large
evening primrose, whose yellow stars come out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
each night all through the summer,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the foxglove,
which will sometimes grow eight feet high and
bear from two to three hundred flowers upon a
single stem, herbaceous phloxes of every variety
of red and purple hue, pæonies and irises, and for
late autumn the old Michaelmas daisy, are among
the most suitable plants for this purpose.</p>

<p>Passing into the walled garden, we shall probably
find the northern side taken up with
vineries and plant-houses, with which, however,
we have nothing to do, except in so far as they
supply us with any tender or half-hardy plants
for our garden-beds. In front of these houses
will be great borders of stocks and mignonette,
scenting the air&mdash;the mignonette sweetest when
the sun is strongest, and the stocks as evening falls.
Broad walks and thick hedges of yew, or privet,
or the tree-box, divide the flower from the kitchen
garden; and where the walks intersect, there may
perhaps be an old-fashioned pond with aquatic
plants or a fountain; and here let me say that the
rarer aquatic plants might be much more grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>than they are at present, and of all none is more
charming than the <i>Aponogeton distachyon</i>, with its
little scent-laden boats of blossom. Every available
garden wall will be covered with fruit-trees, beautiful
in spring time with the pink flowers of peach and
nectarine, or the white bloom of pear and cherry.
Near the vineries will probably be the flower
garden, divided into small beds by narrow gravel
walks, and with long strips of garden stretching
down along the side of the vegetables or gooseberry
bushes, so that even here there will be something
of fragrance and of beauty. Even the kitchen-garden
itself may be so arranged as to keep the
more homely kail-yard out of sight. The graceful
plumes of asparagus, the broad grey leaves of the
globe artichoke, the trailing luxuriance of the
gourd, and above all the festoons of scarlet runners
(especially when trained along strings fastened to
a centre pole so as to form cones or tents) are
anything but unsightly; then a corner should be
found for a small herb-garden, with little patches
of sage and marjoram, and thyme and mint and
fennel. There should be rosemary too, and tansy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
for Easter Sunday, and borage to supply a blue
flowering sprig for claret-cup.</p>

<p>When we come to the flower-beds themselves,
we have an almost infinite variety of flowers from
which to choose for their adornment. In old
days, when the tulips were over, there were beds
of anemones and ranunculus&mdash;and a bed of ranunculus
when the sun shines full upon the scarlet
petals is a glorious sight. Then came annuals
and herbaceous plants. Now, as each year brings
something new, and the old plants, if out of
fashion, can yet generally be procured, our
difficulty is the difficulty of selection.</p>

<p>We have already quoted Harrison’s description
of his Elizabethan garden, but it is of course in
the old English Herbals that we find the fullest
account of what was grown, whether for beauty
or for use. The most famous of these are the
<i>Grete Herbal</i>, by Peter Treveris, published in
1516, and Turner’s <i>Herbal</i>, with the date of 1568;
but better known than either are Gerard’s <i>Herbal</i>,
of which the first edition appeared in 1597, and
Parkinson’s <i>Paradisus Terrestris</i>, published in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
1629, and dedicated to Henrietta Maria. An
early chapter in Parkinson is taken up with the
various edgings for “knots and trayles,” and he
says, “the one are living herbes, and the others
are dead materials, as leade, boords, bones, tyles,
&amp;c.” Among “living herbes” he mentions thrift as
having been “most anciently received,” lavender,
cotton, and slips of juniper or yew; but on the
whole he recommends “French or Dutch boxe.”
His flowers, he divides into English and “outlandish”
flowers, and his list is extensive enough
for a good garden of to-day. “Of daffodils,” he
writes, “there are almost a hundred sorts;” and
his list of “tulipas,” as he calls them, extends
over several pages, and is at least as full as a
modern nurseryman’s catalogue.</p>

<p>Two hundred and fifty years have passed since
this was written, and innumerable new varieties
and species have since been introduced. To name
no others, we have the annuals of California and
the flowering shrubs of Japan, the heliotrope of
Peru, the fuchsia of Chili, and the dahlia of
Mexico. But the illustrated pages of Curtis, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Sweet, and of Loudon, will help us in our choice
of flowers, whether annuals or herbaceous plants.
It is impossible to do more than recall the
names of some of the oldest favourites: and first
among the flowers of the year is the Christmas
rose. “I saw,” quaintly says old Sir Thomas
Browne’s son, writing in 1664, “I saw black hellebore
in flower which is white;” and certainly
clusters of the large Christmas rose, especially
when the slight protection of a bell-glass has been
given to them, are hardly less beautiful than the
Eucharis itself.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Then come the snowdrops,
which should be planted not only on the border,
but on some bit of grass, where they may remain
undisturbed till the leaves have died away. There
is a delightful passage in Forbes Watson’s <i>Flowers
and Gardens</i> (and Ruskin himself has hardly
entered into the secret life of plants more sympathetically),
in which, speaking of the first snowdrop
of the year, he says:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In this solitary coming forth, which is far more beautiful when
we chance to see it thus amidst the melting snow rather than on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>dark bare earth, the kind little flower, however it may gladden us,
seems itself to wear an aspect almost of sorrow. Yet wait another
day or two till the clouds have broken and its brave hope is accomplished,
and the solitary one has become a troop, and all down the
garden amongst the shrubs the little white bunches are dancing
gaily in the breeze. Few flowers undergo such striking change of
aspect, so mournful in its early drooping, so gladsome when full
blown and dancing in the sunshine.”</p>

<p class="p1">The crocus comes next, the same crocus that
once “brake like fire” at the feet of the three
goddesses, whom poor Œnone saw on Ida. This
should always be planted, not in thin lines, but
in thick clusters, for only then can be seen the
wonderful rich depths of colour, which open out
to the sun. Tufts of crocus, too, should spring
up beneath the branches of deciduous or weeping
trees, where the grass is bare in early spring, and
when once planted the crocus seems to go on for
ever. A writer in the <i>Gardeners’ Chronicle</i> says
that it is known that a particular patch of white
crocus has been in the same spot for above 120
years. It is sometimes said that in course of time
the yellow crocus will turn into the coarser
and commoner purple crocus. This must be a
mere fallacy, but it sometimes appears as if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
were true. The fact, we take it, is that if the
two varieties are placed together the stronger one
will gradually get possession of the ground, and
supplant the more delicate yellow, just as (as old
Waterton used to say) the Hanoverian rats turned
out the old brown rat of the country.</p>

<p>Other Spring flowers are far less cultivated in
great gardens than in those of less pretension;
but no flowers give more pleasure, both from their
own beauty, and as being among the first flowers
of the year. There are the auricula, or “Basier”
(as it is called in Lancashire ballads), with its
velvet petals and its powdered leaves; the double
primrose, faint smelling of the spring; the hepatica,
whose bright little blossoms sparkle like
unset gems; the pulmonaria, with blossoms half
blue, half red, and milk-stained leaves, for which
sacred legends can alone account. Then, above
all, are the daffodils, most loved of flowers by the
poets, though, once again, in preference to any
poet, as less known yet admirable in their way,
I will quote a few words from Forbes Watson’s
book. “The daffodil,” he says, “is a plant which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
affords a most beautiful contrast, a cool watery
sheet of leaves, with bright warm flowers, yellow
and orange, dancing over the leaves, like meteors
over a marsh.” But we cannot, of course, pass in
review all the flowers of the Spring, though we
must urge a claim for such old-fashioned plants
as Solomon’s seal with its palm-like leaves, and
the crown-imperial with its circlet of orange-bells.</p>

<p>To beds of anemone, ranunculus, and tulips
we have already referred, and we need not again
recur to ordinary Spring bedding.</p>

<p>But of course there should always be a bank of
violets, over which the soft winds will play, stealing
and giving odour; and no less, of course, a
bed of lilies of the valley&mdash;planted alone, so that
their roots may spread to any distance&mdash;with their
sweet white bells peering here and there from
“their pavilion of tender green.”</p>

<p>The herbaceous borders of early summer
become gayer still, though the individual plants
are perhaps less interesting. We have now, with
numberless others, the snowflake, the hairy red
poppy, the valerian, mulleins of various sorts, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
early gladiolus, the large flowering lupin, and
above all, lilies. The variety of lilies, all beautiful,
and nearly all easily grown, is quite remarkable,
and we doubt whether (comparatively at
least) any flower is more neglected.</p>

<p>Then come roses, and we would strongly
recommend that, in addition to the newer “remontant”
roses, the old roses and the old way
of growing them should not be quite forgotten.
Standard roses are all very well, but a rosebush
covered over with blossom is very often much
better. “Madame Rothschild” is pre-eminent in
beauty, but (if she will tolerate the “odorous”
comparison) the old cabbage rose or moss rose
has a charm of scent and of association of which
their fashionable rival is entirely devoid. The old
pink china or monthly rose, which flowers on from
early summer to latest autumn, deserves a bed to
itself. It should be trained and pegged down, as
is so constantly done in Belgium and Holland, and
the blue lobelia should be planted in between.
A bed of the yellow briar-rose is still more beautiful,
but it lasts for weeks only instead of months.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Other beautiful old summer roses are the maiden’s
blush, the Portland rose, the rose unique, and the
rose Celeste. But no rose, taking all the good
qualities of a rose together, its hardiness, free
blooming, beauty, and scent, will surpass the
Gloire de Dijon, though the golden cups of
Marshal Niel may be richer in colour, and the
fragrance of La France recalls, as no other rose
does, the luscious fragrance of Oriental otto of
roses.</p>

<p>And now, instead of ordinary bedding-out, let
me suggest some garden-beds which are far more
effective. One is a bed of <i>Lilium auratum</i>, with
heliotrope to fill up the spaces. Another is
<i>Agapanthus umbellatus</i>, surrounded by <i>Lobelia
cardinalis</i>. Then there should be beds of cannas,
of gladiolus, of <i>Clematis Jackmanni</i> trained over
withies, of zinnias, of the new hybrid begonias,
and of asters. Somewhere room should be found
for a border of everlastings, and somewhere for a
row of the large red linum. One border may be
given up to annuals, and it is no bad plan to mix
the seeds of some twenty varieties, and let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
grow up together as they will. The blue cornflower
should have a piece of ground to itself, and
so of course should the carnations. The white
pinks will already have perfumed the herbaceous
border with their aromatic scent, and the sweet-william
and antirrhinum will also have claimed
a place. The convolvulus major should have a
chance of climbing upon a trellis, and the large
nasturtium of trailing over a bank; and where the
<i>Tropæolum speciosum</i>, which is one of the great
ornaments of the gardens at Minto and elsewhere
in Scotland, can be made to flourish in our
English garden, it will be found as beautiful as
either.</p>

<p>Above all, no garden should be without its
hedge of sweet peas. If the pods are diligently
pulled off, new flowers will be as constantly thrown
out, and the “purfled scarf” of blossoms will
remain in beauty till the first killing frost. It is
easy to get a dozen different shades of colour, and
nothing can look gayer, or give a more delicious
scent. Keats&mdash;than whom no poet ever described
flowers more accurately&mdash;speaks of the sweet pea’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
“wings of gentle flush o’er delicate white,” and
of its “taper fingers catching at all things.”</p>

<p>Clumps of hollyhock, crusted over with bloom,
should be planted near a sundial, or (as says the
author of the well-known essay on “The Poetry
of Gardening”), “in a long avenue, the double
and the single, not too straitly tied, backed by
a dark thick hedge of old-fashioned yew.”</p>

<p>Sunflowers, also in clumps, should stand out
here and there, and though the modern sceptics
may tell us that this American plant cannot be
the Clytie of Grecian story, it amply vindicates
its name by its large discs, surrounded
by golden rays. Tritomas should hold up their
scarlet maces to the sun, among tufts of the
<i>Arundo conspicua</i>, or (better still, if possible) of
Pampas grass. Lastly, we must not forget to
plant, for the sake of their delicious scent, as
the summer evening falls, the curious Schizopetalon,
and the better known Mathiola, or
night-scented stock.</p>

<p>But, besides its flowers, the garden is alive with
other happy forms of life. The blackbird, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Laureate tells us, will “warble, eat, and dwell”
among the espaliers; and the thrush, as Mr. Browning
reminds us, “sings each song twice over” from
some blossoming pear-tree. Then the bees are
busy all summer long, rifling for themselves the
flowers, and setting for us the fruit. “The butterflies
flutter from bush to bush, and open their
wings to the warm sun,” and a peacock or red
admiral, or better still, a humming-bird moth,
is always a welcome guest. Only the other
day I heard a delightful story (I wish I were
satisfied that it was a fact) of a lady who got
some chrysalises of butterflies from Italy and
elsewhere, and, planting in a corner of her
garden the herbs and flowers in which they
most delighted, had hovering around, for many
weeks of summer, these beautiful strange visitors
from the south.</p>

<p>One great charm of a garden lies in the certainty
that it will never be the same two years
running. If we were only confident that each
year was to be precisely like the last, it may fairly
be doubted whether we could feel the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
interest in our task. It is really no paradox to
say, that it is fortunate that gardening should
be always more or less of a struggle, for the very
struggle, as should always happen, has the element
of pleasure about it. Each year there will be
success on one side, if something of failure on
another. And there are always difficulties
enough. There are difficulties arising from bad
seasons, from climate, or from soil. There are
weeds that worry, and seeds that fail. There are
garden pests of every variety. The mice nibble
away the tulip-bulbs: the canker gets into the
rosebud, and the green fly infests the rose. Wire-worms
destroy the roots of tender annuals, and
slugs breakfast upon their sprouting leaves.
Moles and birds and caterpillars have each and
all their peculiar plans for vexing the gardener’s
heart. Then again certain plants are attacked by
special diseases of their own. The gladiolus turns
yellow and comes to nothing, and a parasitic
fungus destroys the hollyhock. And yet, if there
were no difficulties to contend against, no forethought
to be exercised, no ingenuity to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
displayed, no enemies to conquer, it is surely
impossible that we could feel the same pleasure
and personal triumph in our success. Then, too,
each year the intelligent gardener will arrange new
combinations, grow new varieties of plants, and
aim after a perfection which he can never hope
to reach.</p>

<p>But the garden has no less also a scientific
interest. Fresh species of plants are continually
enriching our flower-beds, and botanists are
constantly searching the wildest and most remote
corners of the world on behalf of the English
stove-house, conservatory, and garden. They
endure untold hardships, and risk many dangers,
if only they may secure some new treasure.
Often they have caught deadly fever or met
with fatal accidents in their search, and, true
martyrs of science as they are, they pass away
forgotten, except perchance when some unwonted
designation of a plant may recall, not
their memory indeed, but their name. But as
one drops off, another will succeed; and so,
among far coral islands of the Pacific, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
tropical recesses of a South American forest, in
the heart of Asiatic mountains, or the unexplored
mysteries of New Guinea, these lovers
of nature are at work, labouring for our pleasure
and instruction, and procuring for us new forms
of vegetable life and beauty. And meanwhile
science is working at home in another and a
happier way. Not content with finding new
species of plants, she is for ever developing
fresh varieties. The art is no new one, and in
old days the simpler minds of men were not
quite sure of its propriety. It was unnatural,
they used to say. It is in vain that Polixenes
tells Perdita that there is an art that does mend
nature, and, therefore, is nature. She evidently
thinks it all sophistry, and not a gillyflower
will she have.</p>

<p class="ppi10 p1">“I’ll not put<br />
The dibble in the earth to set one slip of them.”</p>

<p class="pn1">And so, too, Andrew Marvell’s mower complains
of the gardener that</p>

<p class="ppqh6 p1">“The pink grew then as double as his mind;<br />
The nutriment did change the kind;</p>
<p class="pph6">With strange perfumes he did the roses taint,<br />
And flowers themselves were taught to paint.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">He thinks it a wicked extravagance, as it certainly
was, to sell a meadow for the sake of
a tulip root, and he thinks it an absurdity, as it
certainly was not, that we should have brought
the “Marvel of Peru” over so many miles of
ocean; but all this might be forgiven, but not
the “forbidden mixtures” which grafting and
hybridizing have brought about. Meanwhile, as
we are now untroubled by such scruples, we
may not only enjoy the results of the art of the
skilful florist, but may even take an intelligent
interest in the art itself. It lets us into many
secrets of nature. It helps to explain problems
of much higher significance than the brief
existence of a garden flower. It makes us
understand, in some small degree, how, in every
form of life, a higher type may be produced
from one of inferior order.</p>

<p>And the results are really wonderful. It is
difficult to know what class of plants has in late
years most profited by the artful nature, or
unnatural art, of the skilful gardener; but
certainly, some of the most striking successes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
have been among roses, clematis, begonias, and
rhododendrons.</p>

<p>But it is not the florist only who has been
helping on the cause of botanical science at home.
Within the last few years the botanists, or rather
perhaps the naturalists, have been increasingly
busy among both the English field and garden
flowers. The old botanists indeed had examined
with every minuteness the structure and economy
of the blossoms, had counted the stamens and
the pistils, and known the origin of the swelling
of the seed-vessel. And what Linnæus had
systematized, Erasmus Darwin endeavoured to
turn into a romance. Science was to be made
popular in a long didactic poem, and <i>The Loves
of the Plants</i> was the curious result. But to treat
the various organs of a plant as if they were
human beings and endowed with human passions,
was obviously too far-fetched a conceit to give real
pleasure, and it was not wonderful that Mathias,
and many others, should have laughed at those, who</p>

<p class="ppq p1">“In sweet tetrandrian monogynian strains<br />
Pant for a pistil in botanic pains.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">And then the illustrators took the matter up,
and in Thornton’s <i>New Illustrations of the
Sexual System of Linnæus</i>, which is perhaps
one of the most beautiful botanical works ever
published, we have pictures of plants with
Cupid aiming a shaft at them, and with a
letterpress of love-verses. Into the new system
introduced by Jussieu, and now generally
adopted for purposes of classification, we need
not enter. The Natural system, as it is called,
which is certainly the sensible system, has now
held its own for many years, though the more
artificial system of Linnæus has still its use and
votaries.</p>

<p>The most recent investigators into botanical
science are not classifying plants, but they are
examining into the meaning of their structure.
The mere task of description and enumeration
has been done, and so they have set themselves
to find out why certain structures exist, and why
certain habits (if we may use the word) have been
formed. Why do the climbing plants climb at
all? and why do some twine, and others cling?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Why do the fly-catching plants cause the death
of numbers of unlucky insects? Why are the
stamens and pistils in plants of such various
lengths and sizes? Why have some flowers a
hairy fringe, and others drops of nectar in their
calyces? What is the meaning of the scent of
flowers, and what is the object of the night-opening
flowers? The key to many of these
questions is in the relationship of flowers to insects;
and Charles Darwin, Sir John Lubbock,
and others, have done very much to explore and
then to popularize the subject. Much that is
most important has thus been made known to
us, but these eminent naturalists would be the
first to own that there is much more still to do.
The secrets of nature open out but slowly, and
after long and patient wooing. It would sometimes
appear too as if there might be danger,
not indeed of adapting facts to theory, but of
taking it too readily for granted that all facts
must eventually fit into some favourite theory.
This tendency may not be so apparent in the
leaders as in their less cautious disciples in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
scientific researches. From some of their expressions
they would almost seem to imply that
insects were made for the sake of fertilizing
flowers. They attribute the bright colour and
beauty of flowers not to the same good purpose
that gives beauty elsewhere, but as if it were
merely that insects may be attracted, and do
their duty among the ripening pollen. They are
contemptuous at the idea of a flower being intended
for the selfish pleasure of man and not
for its own purposes, and they point to plants of
beauty that “blush unseen” where man cannot
admire them, forgetting, however, that man <i>has</i>
seen them, or he would not know of their existence.
They will learn nothing of the affluence
of nature, and nothing is quite accepted unless
its use can be established, though on this principle
it is hard to explain why, as Bishop Hall
pointed out long ago, “there is many a rich
stone laid up in the bowels of the earth, many
a faire pearle laid up in the bosome of the sea,
that never was seen, nor never shall be.”</p>

<p>It is curious how apparent extremes will meet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
The very men who would most readily throw over
the old theological argument of “design,” which
believed that everything was done in the most
perfect way for the most perfect ends, will now
in the interests of evolution show the necessity
for each curve of a flower-cup and for each
marking on a petal. We cannot be too thankful
to them, if only they will make their ground sure
at every step; but it will not do to generalize
too rapidly. For instance, it has been stated
that veins on a flower are probably guides
to lead insects down into the honey-cup below,
and that night-blowing flowers are without
them because at night they would be invisible
and useless. Unfortunately, it has since been
shown that the <i>Œnothera taraxicifolia</i>, and probably
other night-flowers, are deeply marked
with veins. Again, why in some cherry-blossoms
is the pistil longer than the stamens, so that the
fertilization must be effected differently to what
it is in the more ordinary varieties, where the
stamens and pistil are of equal length? Why
have blossoms gradually developed properties to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
attract insects, when it is obvious that those
properties were not originally required for the
perpetuation of the species? Why should some
flowers of magnificent size, like the magnolia,
require scent to attract insects, if we must indeed
admit that use and not pleasure is the end and
aim of every attraction of the garden? And if
scent is necessary in this case, why is it not
so where the flower is small and insignificant?
Why among roses has La France a delicious
perfume, and Baroness Rothschild none?</p>

<p>But such questionings are inevitable as yet:
meanwhile facts are accumulating, and the whole
truth, thanks to the patient and laborious workers
of our time, may one day be known.</p>

<p>But quite apart from scientific interests, a real
old garden, unaltered and unspoiled, has a peculiar
interest of its own. It is sure to be haunted
by associations, and nothing calls up associations
so quickly and certainly as a sudden scent of
flowers coming and going upon the summer air.
Time and change may have been busy since some
long-absent member of the family has revisited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
his old home, but the flowers and their fragrance,
still the same as ever, will call up all the past.
There is the corner where the first violets were
always found; there is the rosebush from which
a flower may once have been gathered of which
the poor faded petals still remain; there is the
lavender, which supplied the oaken presses where
the house-linen was always kept. And, apart
from all such fond and foolish private memories,
there are all the associations with which literature
has consecrated the old garden-flowers. Pelargoniums,
calceolarias, verbenas, and the rest of the
new-comers have but few friends, but not an old
flower but is “loaded with a thought,” as Emerson
says of the asters on the slopes at Concord.
Roses, lilies, violets, primroses, and daffodils, have
been written about over and over again, and the
words of great poets rise unbidden to the memory
at sight of them. And then certain flowers will
recall an entire scene, and Marguerite asks her
fate from the large white daisy whose name she
bears, or Corisande, in her garden of every perfume,
gathers&mdash;but not for herself&mdash;her choicest rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>While a garden owes so much to the poet’s
pen, it is strange that it should owe comparatively
little to the artist’s brush. Who can recall
a single picture of gardens or of flowers that
ever gave him any great amount of pleasure! Is
Watteau an exception? But it is the figures in
the foreground, not the garden, for which one
really cares. And of flower-painters, there are
Van Huysum and the Dutchmen, with their piles
and masses of blossom, of large size, but generally
of dull colour, and without light or warmth
about them. Then there are our English flower-painters;
with some the flowers are only subsidiary
to the picture, and they seem to have
adopted Gilpin’s advice that</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“By a nice representation of such trifles, he [the painter] would be
esteemed puerile and pedantic. Fern-leaves perhaps, or dock, if
his piece be large, he might condescend to imitate; but if he
wanted a few touches of red or blue or yellow, to enliven and
enrich any particular spot on his foreground, instead of aiming at
the exact representation of any natural plant, he will more judiciously
give the tint he wants in a few random general touches of
something like nature, and leave the spectator, if he please, to find
out a resemblance. Botanical precision may please us in the flowerpieces
of Van Huysum, but it would be paltry and affected in the
landscapes of Claude or Salvator.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">But even when the flower or plant is something
better than a “touch” of colour, there is
often some gross carelessness, or ignorance, which
gives a sense of annoyance rather than of pleasure.
Each returning year, the <i>Gardeners’ Chronicle</i> reviews
the Royal Academy from a botanical point
of view, and nothing can be droller than the
blunders it points out. Sometimes all sorts of
flowers of various seasons are growing together,
or a wood, through which a knight is riding, is
adorned with agarics and fungi that belong to
different periods of the year. Sometimes places,
no less than times, are set at nought, as in an
instance quoted by Mr. Rossetti from the Exhibition
of 1868, where a Greek maiden is gathering
blossoms from a pot of (American) azaleas. But,
indeed, such instances are only too common. In
how many modern classical pictures, for example,
has not the large sunflower of America been
introduced? But when the flower itself is one
important part of the picture, how curiously unsatisfactory
is too often the result! No one has
tried more earnestly to set our painters right in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
these matters than Mr. Ruskin, and how little
even now have they profited by his teaching!
They catch hold of a suggestion, as when he once
told them (<i>showed</i> them, we might say) that a
spray of pink apple-blossom against a blue sky
was beautiful, and the next exhibition or two
abounded in blossoming apple-boughs: but they
seem unable to grasp a principle. It was in 1851,
in his tract on “Pre-Raphaelitism,” that he urged
the painting of “the heather as it grows, and
the foxglove and the harebell as they nestle in
the clefts of the rocks;” and this last year, while
speaking of the same artist, Mr. Hunt, he has had
to repeat the same lesson, that plants that grow
are pleasanter objects than flowers that are
gathered. And, indeed, the reason is not far to
seek. A bunch of garden-roses thrown carelessly
down upon a mossy bank&mdash;and there is scarcely
an exhibition without one&mdash;not only gives one a
feeling of incongruity (as though the fashionable
flowers were out at a picnic), but a stronger
feeling still of coming death. We know those
roses must wither and die, almost, we fancy, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
we look upon them. No dew that falls can now
keep them alive, as it will the humble moss&mdash;so
much better than they&mdash;on which they rest. And
it is almost worse when the poor gathered flowers
are brought indoors and placed in some blue jar
or Salviati vase, and the artist shows how carefully
he can draw, not so much the petals of the
flowers as the texture of the porcelain or the
iridescence of the glass. It is difficult enough
worthily to paint the light and glow of colour in
any beautiful flower, but, if it is to be painted,
let it be when the plant is still growing, and as
it grows. Any garden will give subjects enough,
if they are only sought for. Here is a bank of
daffodils; here the white narcissus and the red
anemone have formed a group; here a blue
forget-me-not looks up into the bell of the
snake’s-head fritillary; here is a great peony
bowed down with its crimson globes; here a
nasturtium trails its bright yellow blossoms along
a bit of grey old rock; here a cluster of hollyhocks
keep watch by a garden walk; here the
purple clematis clings to the orchard hedge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Pictures of flowers such as these, if only the
artist have some sense of colour and some refinement
of taste, would give a real and almost a
new pleasure to us all.</p>

<p>But there must be no artistic grouping, or
representing of things as they should be rather
than as they are. The work must be conscientious,
as in the case of a great living sculptor
who, having to carve an ivy plant upon a tablet,
went himself to study the form of growing ivy,
and found how entirely different it is from the
conventional wreaths of the ordinary marble-mason.</p>

<p>There is one question in connection with English
horticulture to which at first sight it does not
seem quite easy to give a satisfactory answer.
Are the flower-shows, the number of which is
constantly increasing, an advantage or not? They
certainly stimulate the production of magnificent
fruit, of beautiful florist-flowers, and of handsome
stove and greenhouse plants. But how do they
affect the gardens in which these prize specimens
are grown? It is mere matter of fact that, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a gardener begins to think of exhibiting, he is
very apt to pay undue attention to the plants
which will secure him prizes and reputation. If
his master is satisfied with the usual monotony
of garden-beds, why should the gardener give
special attention to what can be of no service to
himself? So he throws his whole strength into
some bunches of grapes, some dozen roses, some
trained chrysanthemums. And this is not the
worst of it. The “dressing” of particular blooms
has recently become an art, and little curling-irons
are employed to get petals into their
proper shape, and other various devices are used
for various flowers. But there is after all a
morality in these things. It is allowable to cut
away superfluous petals, but it is not allowable
to insert fragments of another blossom. This
seems to be the limit. Now we confess the whole
system seems to us thoroughly bad, and we
recommend the managers of flower-shows to
forbid “dressing” of every kind. If not exactly
dishonest in itself, it leads on, and very easily,
to the worst forms of dishonesty. But indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in almost every aspect, nothing can be more
spoiling to the gardener than these flower-shows
so constantly are. In the first place, the prize-ticket
generally asserts that the prize is adjudged
to “Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, gardener to&mdash;&mdash;.” The owner of
the garden is nobody, and the gardener is
everything. The prize is in almost every case
regarded as the unchallenged property of the
gardener, who has, nevertheless, won the prize
by his master’s plant, reared at his master’s
expense, and at the cost of time which has
made him too frequently neglect much more
important matters.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder if horticulture in its best sense&mdash;that
is, the culture of the garden as a whole&mdash;is
not what it should be? No gardener can get
prizes for well-kept beds, for effects of harmonious
colouring, for arrangement of shrubberies, for the
grouping of herbaceous plants. He is tempted
for the sake of a single specimen to sacrifice the
beauty of a whole plant, or the clusters of an
entire fruit-tree. That it is most important for
nurserymen to be able to compare new species,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
or new varieties of old species, is of course
undeniable. That our ordinary flower-show is for
the ordinary spectator an extremely pretty sight
is no less certain. But we are satisfied that in
the majority of cases it is the wiser course for
any one who really cares about his garden, and
would rather have a succession of well-cultured
flowers than some merely exceptional success, to
discourage his gardener from exhibiting.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I can only repeat that “the
English flower-garden” may afford far greater
pleasure than it does at present. We must learn
to look on plants, not as mere points of colour,
but as old friends on whose coming we can rely,
and who, returning with the recurring seasons,
bring back with them pleasant memories of past
years. And if, as often happens, they are plants
consecrated by song or legend, the imagination
is quickened as surely as the heart is stirred.
We must remember, too, that our personal
delight in a garden is entirely independent of
its size or the perfection of its appliances. A
child’s garden, such as Mary Howitt once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
described, a few pots of musk or mignonette on
the window-ledge of a schoolboy’s study, will
afford a pleasure which acres of garden, left
only to the gardener’s care, can never give.
“How <i>can</i> I care for this garden? It is so
much too large to care about”&mdash;a lady, who
owns one of the famous gardens in the north
of England, once said to me; and it was impossible
not to appreciate the difficulty.</p>

<p>Indeed, as with everything else, the garden
will soon grow dull, and the flowers lose their
attraction, unless we take the management, partly
at least, into our own hands, and be masters not
in name but in reality. It is not necessary to
understand every matter of detail, though our
interest will strengthen as our practical knowledge
grows; but at least we may make up our minds
as to what we want to have done, and then take
care that the gardener carries out our orders.
We are too often the absolute slaves of our
gardeners, and they in turn (of course I am
not speaking of exceptions) are too often the
slaves of an unintelligent routine. We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
learnt, as Bacon said, “to <i>build stately</i> sooner
than to <i>garden finely</i>, as if gardening were the
greater perfection.” It is really about time that
we learnt the more difficult lesson.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">THE GARDENER BOWER-BIRD.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">This</span> curious bird was first described by Schlegel, and
a coloured illustration of its garden and bower will be
found in Gould’s <i>Birds of New Guinea</i>. The fullest
account, however, seems to be that of Signor Beccari,
which first appeared in a scientific periodical of Genoa.
It was translated for the <i>Gardeners’ Chronicle</i> of March
11, 1878, and I am permitted to make use of the very
interesting narrative:</p>

<p>“The <i>Amblyornis inornata</i>&mdash;or, as I propose to name
it, the Bird-gardener&mdash;is a Bird of Paradise of the dimensions
of a turtle-dove. The specific name ‘inornata’
well suggests its very simple dress. It has none of the
ornaments common to the members of its family, its
feathers being of several shades of brown, and showing
no sexual differences.</p>

<p>“It was shot some years ago by the hunters of
Mynheer von Rosenberg. The first descriptions of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
powers of building (the constructions were called
‘nests’) were given by the hunters of Mynheer Bruijn.
They endeavoured to bring one of the nests to Ternate,
but it was found impossible to do this, both by reason
of its great size and the difficulty of transporting it.</p>

<p>“I have fortunately been able to examine these
constructions at remote places where they are erected.
On June 20, 1875, I left Andai for Hatam, on Mount
Arfak. I had been forced to stay a day at Warmendi
to give rest to my porters. At this time only five men
were with me; some were suffering from fever, and the
remaining porters declined to proceed. We had been
on our way since early morning, and at one o’clock we
intended to proceed to the village of Hatam, the end
of our journey.</p>

<p>“We were on a projecting spur of Mount Arfak.
The virgin forest was very beautiful. Scarcely a ray
of sunshine penetrated the branches. The ground was
almost destitute of vegetation. A little trackway proved
that the inhabitants were at no great distance. A
limpid fountain had evidently been frequented. I
found here a new Balanophora, like a small orange or
a small fungus. I was distracted by the songs and the
screams of new birds, and every turn in the path showed
me something new and surprising. I had just killed
a small new marsupial (<i>Phascelogale dorsalis</i>, Pet, and
Doria), that balanced itself on the stem of a great tree
like a squirrel, and turning round, I suddenly stood
before the most remarkable specimen of the industry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
an animal. It was a hut or bower close to a small
meadow enamelled with flowers. The whole was on
a diminutive scale. I immediately recognised the
famous nests described by the hunters of Bruijn. I did
not suspect, however, then, that they had anything to
do with the constructions of the Chlamydodeæ. After
well observing the whole, I gave strict orders to my
hunters not to destroy the little building. That, however,
was an unnecessary caution, since the Papuans
take great care never to disturb these nests or bowers,
even if they are in their way. The birds had evidently
enjoyed the greatest quiet until we happened, unfortunately
for them, to come near them. We had reached
the height of about 4,800 feet, and after half an hour’s
walk we were at our journey’s end.”</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid"><span class="smcap">The Nest.</span></p>

<p>“I had now full employment in the preparation of
my treasure, and I gave orders to my people not to shoot
many of the birds. The nest I had seen first was
the nearest one to my halting-place. One morning I
took colours, brushes, pencils, and gun, and went to
the spot. While I was there neither host nor
hostess were at home. I could not wait for them. My
hunters saw them entering and going out, when they
watched their movements to shoot them. I could not
ascertain whether this bower was occupied by one pair
or by several pairs of birds, or whether the sexes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in equal or unequal numbers&mdash;whether the male alone
was the builder, or whether the wife assisted in the
construction. I believe, however, that such a nest
lasts for several seasons.</p>

<p>“The Amblyornis selects a flat even place around
the trunk of a small tree, that is as thick and as high
as a walking-stick of middle size. It begins by constructing
at the base of the tree a kind of a cone,
chiefly of moss, of the size of a man’s hand. The
trunk of the tree becomes the central pillar, and the
whole building is supported by it. The height of the
pillar is a little less than that of the whole of the hut,
not quite reaching two feet. On the top of the central
pillar twigs are then methodically placed in a radiating
manner, resting on the ground, leaving an aperture for
the entrance. Thus is obtained a conical and very regular
hut. When the work is complete many other branches
are placed transversely in various ways, to make the
whole quite firm and impermeable. A circular gallery
is left between the walls and the central cone. The
whole is nearly three feet in diameter. All the stems
used by the Amblyornis are the thin stems of an orchid
(Dendrobium), an epiphyte forming large tufts on the
mossy branches of great trees, easily bent like straw,
and generally about twenty inches long. The stalks
had the leaves, which are small and straight, still fresh
and living on them; which leads me to conclude that
this plant was selected by the bird to prevent rotting
and mould in the building, since it keeps alive for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
long time, as is so often the case with epiphytical
Orchids.</p>

<p>“The refined sense of the bird is not satisfied with
building a hut. It is wonderful to find that the bird has
the same ideas as a man, that is to say, what pleases
the one gratifies the other. The passion for flowers and
gardens is a sign of good taste and refinement. I discovered
that the inhabitants of Arfak, however, did
not follow the example of the Amblyornis. Their
houses are quite inaccessible from dirt.”</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid"><span class="smcap">The Garden.</span></p>

<p>“Now let me describe the garden of the Amblyornis.
Before the cottage there is a meadow of moss. This
is brought to the spot and kept free from grass, stones,
or anything which would offend the eye. On this
green turf, flowers and fruits of pretty colour are placed
so as to form an elegant little garden.</p>

<p>“The greater part of the decoration is collected round
the entrance to the nest, and it would appear that the
husband offers there his daily gifts to his wife. The
objects are very various, but always of vivid colour.
There were some fruits of a Garcinia like a small-sized
apple. Others were the fruits of Gardenias of a deep
yellow colour in the interior. I saw also small rosy
fruits, probably of a Scitaminaceous plant, and beautiful
rosy flowers of a splendid new Vaccinium (<i>Agapetes
Amblyorninis</i>). There were also fungi and mottled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
insects placed on the turf. As soon as the objects are
faded they are moved to the back of the hut.</p>

<p>“The good taste of the Amblyornis is not only
proved by the nice home it builds. It is a clever bird,
called by the inhabitants Buruk Gurea&mdash;(master bird),&mdash;since
it imitates the songs and screamings of numerous
birds so well that it brought my hunters to despair,
who were but too often misled by the bird. Another
name of the bird is Tukan Robon, which means a
gardener.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">NOTE II.</h2>

<p class="pc1 lmid">ARS TOPIARIA.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> Romans used the word <i>Topiarius</i> for their
ornamental gardener, and one of his chief duties&mdash;the
<i>Ars topiaria</i> in fact&mdash;was to cut the shrubs, and especially
box-trees, into figures of ships, animals, and
names. There is a well-known passage in one of the
letters of the younger Pliny, in which, while speaking
of his garden, he describes “a sort of terrace, embellished
with various figures, and bounded with a box-hedge,
from which you descend by an easy slope,
adorned with the representation of divers animals in
box answering alternately to each other, into a lawn
overspread with the soft, I had almost said the liquid,
acanthus: this is surrounded by a walk, enclosed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
tonsile evergreens, shaped into a variety of forms.
Beyond it is the <i>gestatio</i> [a sort of avenue in which to
take exercise] laid out in the form of a circus, ornamented
in the middle with box cut in numberless
different figures, together with a plantation of shrubs
prevented by the shears from running up too high; the
whole is fenced in with a wall, covered by box, rising by
different ranges to the top.” Further on he says,
“Having passed through these several winding alleys,
you enter a straight walk, which breaks out into a variety
of others, divided off by box-hedges. In one place you
have a little meadow; in another the box is cut into a
thousand different forms, sometimes into letters expressing
the name of the master, sometimes that of the artificer,
whilst here and there little obelisks rise intermixed
alternately with fruit-trees.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Martial too gives a curious
illustration of the <i>Ars topiaria</i>. A grove of Plane trees
was adorned with <i>topiarian</i> wild beasts,&mdash;among them a
bear; a young boy thrust his hand into the bear’s wide
mouth, and a viper hiding there stung him to death.
What a misfortune, adds Martial, that the bear had not
been a real one. This <i>Ars topiaria</i> had been for some
time in fashion in England when Addison first attacked
it in the <i>Spectator</i> of June 25th, 1712: “Our British
gardeners, on the contrary, instead of humouring nature,
love to deviate from it as much as possible. Our trees
rise in cones, globes, and pyramids. We see the marks
of the scissors upon every plant and bush. I do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>know whether I am singular in my opinion, but, for my
own part, I would rather look upon a tree in all its
luxuriancy and diffusion of boughs and branches than
when it is thus cut and trimmed into a mathematical
figure.”</p>

<p>But this is nothing to the denunciation by Pope, which
may be found in the <i>Guardian</i> of September 29th, 1713.
It is extremely humorous. He declares that</p>

<p>“A citizen is no sooner proprietor of a couple of yews,
but he entertains the thought of erecting them into giants,
like those of Guildhall. I know an eminent cook, who
beautified his country-seat with a coronation dinner in
greens, where you see the champion flourishing on horseback
at one end of the table, and the queen in perpetual
youth at the other. For the benefit of all my loving
countrymen of this curious taste, I shall here publish a
catalogue of greens to be disposed of by an eminent
town gardener, who has lately applied to me on this
head. He represents, that for the advancement of a
politer sort of ornament in the villas and gardens adjacent
to this great city, and in order to distinguish those places
from the more barbarous countries of gross nature, the
world stands much in need of a virtuoso gardener, who
has a turn for sculpture, and is thereby capable of
improving upon the ancients in his imagery of evergreens.
I proceed to his catalogue:</p>

<p>“Adam and Eve in Yew; Adam a little shattered by
the fall of the Tree of Knowledge in the great storm;
Eve and the Serpent very flourishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Noah’s Ark in Holly, the ribs a little damaged for
want of water.</p>

<p>“The Tower of Babel, not yet finished.</p>

<p>“St. George in Box, his arm scarce long enough, but
will be in a condition to stick the Dragon by next April.</p>

<p>“A green Dragon of the same, with a tail of ground-ivy
for the present. N.B. These two not to be sold
separately.</p>

<p>“Edward the Black Prince in Cypress.</p>

<p>“A Laurustine Bear in blossom, with a Juniper
Hunter in berrie.</p>

<p>“A pair of Giants stunted; to be sold cheap.”</p>

<p>And there are various other lots equally remarkable
and interesting.</p>

<p>But the <i>topiarian</i> art has never been either scolded or
laughed entirely out of existence, and we all remember
how many years later when Lovel first visits “The Antiquary”
he found the house of Monkbarns “surrounded
by tall clipped hedges of yew and holly, some of which
still exhibited the skill of the <i>topiarian</i> artist, and
presented curious arm-chairs, towers, and the figures of
St. George and the Dragon. The taste of Mr. Oldbuck
did not disturb these monuments of an art now
unknown, and he was the less tempted so to do, as
it must necessarily have broken the heart of his old
gardener.”</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">A POET’S FLOWER-BED.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> quaintest of all devices in flower-beds was the
one which Mrs. Browning&mdash;then Elizabeth Barrett&mdash;made
for herself when a child. In after years she told
the story of it in a poem, and I venture to extract some
stanzas, as they may not be known to all my readers,
and as they illustrate my subject rather curiously. Hope
End, where Miss Barrett lived, and where this “Hector”
flowered, was once well known to me. Crossing the
Malvern Hills on the Herefordshire side, and passing
the Colwall valley, you find the ground sloping up again
into a little ridge. Here, hidden away in a side valley,
was the strange-looking house, with Moorish pinnacles.
Here was the pond where “little Ellie” found the
“swan’s nest among the reeds.” And here the young
girl of nine years old, who had already drunken so deeply
of “the wine of Cyprus” formed her garden-bed in the
shape of her hero Hector, while a laurel stood on a
mound close by, and the birds sung in an old pear-tree
which cast soft shadows on the ground:</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">THE EVENING PRIMROSE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">I wonder</span> whether the Evening Primrose is as much
grown and cared for as it deserves to be. It is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
American plant, but is now found wild in several parts
of England, notably at Formby, among the Lancashire
sand hills, where tradition says it originally came from a
vessel wrecked on that barren coast. It is mentioned
little, if at all, by our old botanists, and our more modern
poets have for the most part passed it carelessly by.
Southey, however, alludes to it in his well-remembered
lines to the bee, that was still at work, after the Cistus
flowers had fallen and “the Primrose of Evening was
ready to burst.” Keats, too, has a striking passage
about the Evening Primrose, which I quote a little
further on, for I may perhaps make a few extracts from an
article I lately wrote in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> on “The
Garden at Nightfall,” as I have no better words in which
to describe the beauty and charm of these Œnotheras.
The question arising from the veins of flowers I have
already mentioned in <i>The English Flower Garden</i>.</p>

<p>“I have two varieties of Œnotheras or Evening Primroses,
and they are in their full glory to-night. One is
the large flowering yellow Œnothera, which grows from
five to six feet high, and which opens its yellow blossoms
night after night from early summer to late autumn. It
is a curious sight to see the blossoms begin to open. I
had been in the garden shortly after six, and the yellow
buds were still folded within the calyx. Watching
closely, you saw the petals give a sudden start&mdash;they
half release themselves&mdash;and by degrees open out fully
into the blossom, which will last till morning, but begins
to fade after the sun has dried up the dews of night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Keats, whose accurate observation of flowers is often
very remarkable, speaks of</p>

<p class="ppi8 p1">‘A tuft of evening primroses<br />
O’er which the mind may hover till it dozes;<br />
O’er which it well might take a pleasant sleep<br />
But that ’tis <i>ever startled by the leap<br />
Of buds into ripe flowers</i>.’</p>

<p class="p1">But more beautiful still than the yellow Œnotheras is the
white <i>Œnothera taraxicifolia</i>, the evening primrose of
the dandelion leaf. I have a bed of standard roses
which I have carpeted entirely with this Œnothera. It
grows low to the ground, and its leaves, which are deeply
serrated, cover the bed. In the daytime there are the
relics of the last night’s harvest of blossom, but the
flowers look faded, and soon get a pink flush over the
white&mdash;after which they wither away. But to-night
the fresh blooms are out, and I count from sixty to
seventy of them, like stars, some in clusters and some
gleaming singly from the mass of deep foliage. There is,
it almost seems to me, a positive light about them which
no other white flower has, not even the Eucharis or the
Christmas rose. And then the blossoms are so large
when fully open&mdash;at least three inches across the petals.
This Œnothera is from Chili, but the yellow one comes
from North America; and a smaller yellow one, also
from North America, may be found naturalized and now
quite wild in one or two places in England. The name
Œnothera (properly, I suppose, Œnothēra) is said to
have been given because the root smelt of wine; but if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
it is uncertain what the Greek Œnothera really was,
certainly no old Greek could know anything of these
beautiful blossoms of our Western night.</p>

<p>“Sir John Lubbock says that the evening primrose is
probably fertilized by moths, and it would seem at first
sight most likely that this should be the case. To-night&mdash;for
the air, as I have said, is quite still and warm&mdash;is
just the night that I should expect the moths to be at
work; but after long waiting near a large yellow Œnothera
(the one plant had forty blooms), I did not see one
single moth. I returned to the bed of <i>Œnothera taraxicifolia</i>,
and again I could see no moth of any kind.
Meanwhile, a little further off, among a bed of white
Mediterranean heath, which is just as much in flower by
day as it is now, there are several of these wanderers of
the night&mdash;little brown moths of (I think) two different
varieties. There and there alone, and not among the
large open blossoms of the Œnotheras, or among the
delicate tufts of night-scented stock, were the moths
busily engaged. Why, then, do these night-flowers&mdash;if
it be not to attract night insects, and so get fertilized&mdash;expand
their petals as evening falls? We have, I
suspect, a good deal yet to learn on these matters.
Even the two Œnotheras are very unlike in several
respects. The seed-vessel of the <i>Œnothera taraxicifolia</i>
is at the end of a long tube, some seven inches in length,
down which runs the stalk or style of the pistil, and
within this tube I have constantly found little black
flies and grains of pollen. Moreover, the pistil and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
stamens of this Œnothera are as nearly as possible the
same length; so that even before the flower has opened,
a stigma or head of the pistil has got well dusted over
with the pollen of the stamens.</p>

<p>“In the case of the large yellow Œnothera the
pistil stands out above the stamens, and I suppose it
could not be fertilized except by the wind or (more
probably) by insects. The tube that leads to the seed-vessel
is here only about two inches long, and is not
smooth but hairy, so that insects would hardly pass
down. Somehow or other, however, the yellow Œnothera
bears seed much more certainly and abundantly than
the white one. I must add that the veins in both
Œnotheras, and especially in the white one, are very
strongly marked; so that a theory which carries the
high sanction of Sir John Lubbock, that veins are guides
to the honey of a flower, and that they do not exist
in night-opening flowers, as they would be unseen by
night and therefore useless, can hardly, I imagine, be
maintained.”</p>

<p>I believe it is now pretty well ascertained that the
Œnothēra of the ancients was the small Willow-herb
(<i>Epilobium roseum</i>), which in my own garden is the
most familiar of weeds.</p>

<p>Pliny describes it as having exhilarating properties in
wine, as having leaves like those of the Almond-tree,
a rose-coloured flower, many branches, and a long root,
which, when dried, has a vinous smell, and an infusion
of which has a soothing effect on wild beasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>In Baptista Porta’s curious <i>Phytognomonica</i> (published
at the end of the sixteenth century) he says,&mdash;speaking
no doubt of this same Epilobium,&mdash;that the dried root
of the Œnothēra smells of wine; given as a drink it
soothes wild beasts and makes them tame, and rubbed
on the worst wounds it serves to heal them.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid">THE CHRISTMAS ROSE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> Christmas Rose is certainly one of the most
valuable of flowers, but it is a little capricious, growing
luxuriantly in one place, and in another gradually dwindling
off. With me it is always successful, and one secret
may be that the roots are never allowed to be disturbed.
This beautiful flower has rather weird associations. It
is the Black Hellebore of Pliny, and was used as a
poison and in incantations. Spenser plants it with the
“dead sleeping poppy” and all other sad and poisonous
herbs in the garden of Proserpina. Often, however, it
was valued for its medicinal qualities, and was occasionally,
we are told, made use of by literary people for
the purpose of sharpening up their intellects. Gerard
says that “Black Hellebore is good for mad and furious
men, for melancholike, dull, and heavie persons, for those
that are troubled with the falling sickness, for lepers, for
them that are sicke of quartaine ague, and briefly for all
those that are troubled with blacke choler, and molested
with melancholie.” Cowley, too, has a curious poem,
in which the Christmas-flower (as he calls it) speaks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
boasts that, alone of flowers, Winter “still finds me on
my guard,” though the ground is “covered thick in beds
of snow,” and then it sounds its triumphs over all sorts
of ills, physical and mental:</p>

<p class="ppq p1">“I do compose the mind’s distracted frame,<br />
A gift the gods and I alone can claim.”</p>

<p class="p1">Old Dr. Darwin, in his <i>Loves of the Plants</i>, has a
scientific interest of quite another kind in the Christmas
Rose:</p>

<p class="ppq p1">“Bright as the silvery plume, or pearly shell,<br />
The snow-white rose, or lily virgin bell,<br />
The fair Helleboras attractive shone,<br />
Warmed every Sage, and every Shepherd won,”</p>

<p class="pn1">but, when the seed-vessel begins to swell,</p>

<p class="ppq p1">“Each roseate feature fades to livid green.”</p>

<p class="pn1">He adds, in a note, that “The <i>Helleborus niger</i>, or
Christmas Rose, has a large beautiful white flower,
adorned with a circle of tubular two-lipp’d nectaries.
After impregnation the flower undergoes a remarkable
change, the nectaries drop off, but the white corol
remains, and gradually becomes quite green. This
curious metamorphose of the corol, when the nectaries
fall off, seems to show that the white juice of the corol
were before carried to the nectaries for the purpose of
producing honey, because, when these nectaries fall off,
no more of the white juice is secreted in the corol, but
it becomes green, and degenerates into a calyx.”</p>

<p>Dr. Darwin’s theory may or may not be strictly accurate,
but his observation of facts is certainly undoubted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>In one of Keats’s early poems he notices the Hellebore’s
curving leaf,</p>

<p class="ppq3 p1">“As the leaves of Hellebore<br />
Turn to whence they sprung before,<br />
And beneath each ample curl<br />
Peeps the richness of a pearl!”</p>

<p class="p1">But if poets know how to describe a Christmas Rose,
there are others who do not. A horticultural book just
published, says&mdash;and the description is a curiosity&mdash;that
in the month of January, “in our garden, on the hillside,
the Christmas Rose is the sweetest and prettiest
thing to show. Its petals are weak and pale; its perfume
is very faint; if you gather it, the leaves presently
fall off, and the flower is destroyed. Leave it in the
hedge, when it is almost the only thing to gladden the
eye:</p>

<p class="ppq2 p1">“The Christmas Rose, the last flower of the year,<br />
Comes when the holly berries glow and cheer&mdash;<br />
When the pale snowdrops rise from the earth,<br />
So white and spirit-like ’mid Christmas mirth.”</p>

<p class="p1">I wish the writer would show me this curious Christmas
Rose, which grows in a hedge, and has weak
petals and a faint perfume, and is spirit-like! What
can it be? and who <i>could</i> have written these very
unmelodious lines?</p>
